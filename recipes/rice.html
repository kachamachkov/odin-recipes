		<h2>Description:</h2>
		<p>
			White rice is the main side dish made in Brazil. This is the way my mom
			would make it and taught my sister and I. What makes this so different is
			that we fry it in oil with minced onion and garlic before adding water.
			You can also use part water, part chicken broth. The secret is to not let
			it overcook because it should come out loose and not sticky.

				Heat the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook the onion in the oil
				for one minute. Stir in the garlic and cook until the garlic is golden
				brown. Add the rice and salt and cook and stir until the rice begins to
				brown. Pour hot water over rice mixture and stir. Reduce heat to low,
				cover the saucepan, and allow to simmer until the water has been
				absorbed, 20 to 25 minutes.
